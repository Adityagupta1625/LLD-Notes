// The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes or interfaces. It provides a higher-level interface that makes the system easier to use. It is often used to hide the complexity of a system of classes or interfaces from the client. The facade class provides a single interface to access the complex system and shields the client from the complexity of the system.

// Problem: There is a subsystem of classes and interfaces that is difficult to use because of its complexity. We want to provide a simple interface to the subsystem so that it can be used more easily.

// Solution: Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, youâ€™ll have your first facade.

// Structure:

// Facade: This is the facade class that provides a simple interface to the subsystem. It delegates the client requests to the subsystem.

// Additional Facade: This is another facade class that provides a different interface to the subsystem. It delegates the client requests to the subsystem. It is often used to prevent overloading a single facade with unrelated tasks

// Subsystem: This is the complex system of classes and interfaces that the facade is hiding from the client.

// Client: This is the client that uses the facade to access the subsystem.

// These are some of the classes of a complex 3rd-party video
// conversion framework. We don't control that code, therefore
// can't simplify it.
